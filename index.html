        <h2>Will Lewthwaite</h2>
        <h3>Student, Artist, Musician, Photographer</h3>
        <p>I have worked in a variety of professions and that has provided a wealth of knowledge and experience.
          In 2020 I returned to school to build on that experience with new skills that I can apply towards a career
          in
          design and media.
          This webpage is a work in progress. As I learn new things the design will also improve.</p>
        <p>I live in the Comox Valley with my wife and our cat. I enjoy music, art, history, nature, and science.
          I play guitar, percussion, and some keyboards. I do a lot of home recording, and as a hobby I create videos
          for my YouTube channel <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxy8o0J-DcobOQG56dG_FbA"
            target="_blank">Weathered Oak Media</a>.</p>

          <h3>Guitar Nerds Magazine Cover</h3>
          <p>For my DGL 112 Typography course, a major project was designing a magazine cover plus the first few pages.
            This included advertising, a letter from the editor, and an article. I designed the entire project from
            scratch, wrote all of the content, and used my own photos with assistance from my wife. The project received
            high marks and high praise
            from the instructor, and also provided an opportunity to live out a teenage fantasy by putting myself on the
            cover.

          <h3>BC 30,000 BC</h3>
          <p>As a term project in FIN 100 Art History, students were asked to analyze and critique a work of art from a
            period of history
            within the textbook and then come up with their own creative response in whatever form. I chose the artwork
            seen in prehistoric
            cave drawings found in France that are estimated to be well over 30,000 years old. My creative response was
            in two parts:
            I created a large drawing in the style and method of the ancient artists and produced a video documenting
            the
            entire project. This involved research, voice-over recordings, and even composing and recording the
            soundtrack.

          <h3>First Year Web Design</h3>
          <p>In my first year DGL 103 and 113 classes the major course project was to create our very own websites from
            the ground up.
            Being new to web development, my idea was to build a site to showcase my evolving photo and video work under
            my established name
            Weathered Oak Media. The site has minor flaws, but it is something I am proud of for a first attempt.

          <h3>Social Good Call to Action Poster</h3>
          <p>A notable project from my DGL 102 course was a Social Good Call to Action poster. Using design principles
            we learned
            throughout the year, we chose a worthy cause and created posters to raise awareness of an issue with the
            call to action
            clearly noted. Plastic pollution on our beaches is a worldwide issue, so my poster urges people to get
            involved in beach
            cleanups through the Surfrider Foundation. The style of my design is a tribute to the psychedelic concert
            posters of the 1960s,
            particularly the artist Bob Masse, with a modern twist. The angry seagull became a bit of a mascot for my
            entire first year.
